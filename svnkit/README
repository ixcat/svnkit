199Technologies Subversion Toolkit (svnkit)
===========================================
:Author: C.Turner

Overview
========

This set of files attempts to implement a toolkit and documentation for 
implementing subversion repositories in a manner supporting: 

  - multiple users and permissions
  - remote access
  - automatic nightly repository backups

without a high degree of difficulty or administrative overhead.

Organisation & Installation
===========================

The system is intended to be installed into an appropriate application
prefix (usually /var/local/apps for 199Technologies systems) which will
become the home directory for the subversion administrative account.

Common functions and environment configuration is installed into the 
administrative users shell account and a set of named scripts leverages
the common configuration to provide scripted access to the system.

To install the system, perform the following steps:

  - create any intermediate paths and/or filesystems for the subversion
    application installation path.
  - add a subversion group and a subversion administrative user and 
    backup user to that group. The users should have their home directory
    as the application installation path.
    (on DragonFly, the svnadmin.adduser and svnbkup.adduser files are 
     provided for this purpose, simply adduser -f the files and add the 
     the svnbkup user to the groups file.)
  - copy in the contents of the 'nbsd' directory provided with this 
    document to the subversion install path. Currently, the files 
    are as follows::

      nbsd
      nbsd/archive
      nbsd/bin
      nbsd/bin/svn-setup
      nbsd/bin/svnshell
      nbsd/dumps
      nbsd/etc
      nbsd/etc/policies
      nbsd/etc/policies/default
      nbsd/etc/policies/default/authz
      nbsd/etc/policies/default/passwd
      nbsd/etc/policies/default/svnserve.conf
      nbsd/etc/inetd.conf.svnserve
      nbsd/repos
      nbsd/svn-dotprofile
      nbsd/.profile
      
    Each of these files and directories are set with mode 750 and permissions
    svnadmin:svnadmin, with the exception of the 'dumps' and 'archive' 
    directory having mode 770 such that the subversion backup user can 
    write files to that directory.
  - edit the inetd.conf.svnserve file if necessary, adding it to your inetd 
    configuration, and restart inetd.
  - Edit the files in the etc/policies/default location as necessary for your
    site. In this example configuration, authorization and permissions are 
    currently set on a system-wide basis. Various configurations of 
    per-project users, access permissions, etc. should probably be considered
    when necessary in your project.
  - create any new repositories using via `svnkit` as follows::

      svnadmin $ svnkit create_repos reposname

    this will create a repository with the appropriate permissions
    in ~svnadmin/repos/reposname.
  - Add the appropriate policy template to your repository as follows::

      svnadmin $ svnkit apply_policy repos <policy>

    This will configure the repository by copying in all files in 
    ~svnadmin/etc/policies/policyname to reposdir/repos/conf/. If no
    policy is given, the 'default' policy is applied. 
  - import any necessary files as follows::

      svnadmin $ svnkit create_import repository /path/to/sources

    This will import the contents of 'sources' to the location trunk/sources
    in the repository named 'repository'.

  - if you plan on using the svnshell script via the svnkit 'shell' command,
    ensure it is up to date with the version of subversion being used by 
    your site.

    Ideally, the script would would be part of the standard subversion 
    package installation, but it is currently not for pkgsrc and portage 
    and the author has not taken the time to get it included by default - 
    it should be in the appropriate source tarball. On pkgsrc systems,
    you will need to ensure that the `python` executable is available
    in your path, which is conveniently done via pkg_alternatives for
    the test setup used to create this documentation as follows::
    
      # pkg_alternatives manual python24-2.4.3nb3

  - At this point, your new repository should be accessable as follows::

      $ svn (cmd) svn://hostname/reposname

    Where `hostname` and `reposname` are substituted appropriately for
    your host and repository names. It may be most convenient to set up
    a DNS pointer to the subversion server such that if the repositories
    are later relocated, any checked out source code will not need to
    be repointed to the new location.
 
System Backups & Recovery
=========================

The 'dump_repos' and 'dump_all' commands can be used to take full or 
incremental exports of a given set of repositories for backup purposes,
automatically placing the exported data into the `dump/` subdirectory
of the system. The logic in the dump_repos command takes into account
the following:

  - at least 2 `full` dumps are kept at all times when using the `full`
    dump type
  - incremental dumps are removed if older than the oldest `full` dump
  - incremental and full dumps are not taken if the repository has not
    been modified since the last occurrence of any changes in the incremental
    case or since the last full dump in the full case.

It is suggested that the svnkit `dump_all` command be run regularly
to ensure that data is properly backed up in case of accidental damage 
to the live repositories. If large scale data loss is of a concern, the 
dump area should be further backed up for long term storage. 

An example set of crontab(5) files are included with the system 
that are configured to perform full backups weekly and incremental backups
nightly. If you wish to enable this type of backup policy, simply entable 
cron for the svnbackup user and load the files as as follows ::

  svn $ cat etc/*cron |crontab -
   
No svnkit utility command yet exists to easily restore the dumped version of 
a repository. Until such time that a restoration wrapper is written, the 
'svnadmin' command makes restoration of repository dumps fairly trivial.
